    <p>
      Philly Cheesesteak is a sandwich made with super thinly sliced ribeye
      steak, caramelized onion, and provolone cheese. That simple combination is
      the original classic as made popular on the East Coast. The Philly
      Cheesesteak has been modified on the West Coast to include bell peppers
      and mushrooms but a true “Philly” only has steak, onion and cheese served
      over a roll.

      <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
      <li>1 cup grated aged provolone cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
      <li>1 Onion</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds mushrooms (cremini and shiitake)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt 1</li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place steak in freezer for 30 to 45 minutes; this makes it easier to
        slice the meat. Remove the meat from the freezer and slice very thinly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat griddle or grill pan over high heat. Brush steak slices with oil
        and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 45 to 60 seconds per side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place several slices of the meat on the bottom half of the roll, spoon
        some of the cheese sauce over the meat, and top with the mushrooms,
        onions, and peppers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour
        and cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the warm milk, and cook, whisking
        constantly until thickened, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the mixture
        from the heat and whisk in the provolone and Parmesan until combined;
        season with the salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil and butter in a large saute pan over high heat. Add the
        mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms are golden brown. Stir in the
        parsley and season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat butter and oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the
        onions, season with salt and pepper, and cook slowly until golden brown
        and caramelized, stirring occasionally, approximately 30 to 40 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in medium saute pan over high heat. Add the peppers and
        cook until soft. Season with salt and pepper.
