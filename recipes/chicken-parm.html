      Chicken parmigiana, or chicken parmesan (Italian pollo alla parmigiana ),
      is a dish that consists of breaded chicken breast covered in tomato sauce
      and mozzarella, parmesan, or provolone cheese. A quantity of ham or bacon
      is sometimes added.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1/2 cup seasoned breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>2 boneless skinless chicken breast</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1/2 cup pasta sauce</li>
      <li>warmed 4 slices provolone cheese</li>
      <li>1 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>softened 2 ciabatta rolls</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 torn fresh basil leaf</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Arrange three separate shallow bowls or rimmed plates. In one bowl,
        place the flour. In the second bowl, place the beaten egg. In the third
        bowl, combine the bread crumbs with the Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pound the chicken breast halves to even thickness and to fit the size of
        your buns. Season the chicken breast halves with salt and pepper on both
        sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip one of the chicken breasts in the flour to coat both sides and shake
        off excess.
      </li>
      <li>Then dip it into the egg.</li>
      <li>
        Finally, dip the chicken breast into the crumb mixture gently pressing
        to adhere. Repeat with the second chicken breast.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chicken
        and cook until a golden-brown crust forms and chicken is no longer pink
        inside, 4-5 minutes per side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon the marinara sauce over each cooked chicken breast and place two
        slices of provolone cheese on top. Cover until the cheese melts. Remove
        from the heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl combine the softened butter and garlic. Brush onto the
        cut sides of the ciabatta or Italian rolls. Place the rolls cut side up
        on a baking sheet and place under the broiler until browned and crisp.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the toasted bread to a large cutting board. Assemble the
        sandwiches by placing one chicken breast on top of each bottom half of
        bread. Garnish with red pepper flakes and torn fresh basil. Top with the
        other pieces of bread and serve warm.
      </li>
    </ol>
