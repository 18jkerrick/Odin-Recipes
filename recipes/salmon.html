    <p>
      Japanese style-broiled salmon just like the restaurants. Easy recipe I
      came up with at the request of my family. Serve with sticky white rice and
      a light salad.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (1 1/2-pound) salmon fillets, skin removed</li>
      <li>¼ cup sake</li>
      <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>¼ cup water</li>
      <li>½ cup prepared soy-ginger salad dressing</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Fill a large skillet
        with about 1 inch of water and bring to a boil. Poach fish just until
        cooked on the outside, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer fillets to a
        broiler pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, stir together the miso paste, sake, brown sugar, sesame
        seeds, sesame oil, water, salad dressing and rice vinegar. Spread this
        over the tops of the salmon fillets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until almost cooked
        through. Switch the oven to broil, and broil until the top is browned
        and bubbly, about 5 more minutes. Cut fillets into portions to serve.

    </ol>
